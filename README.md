# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Classifier-Model-for-Predicting-Employee-Churn

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Classifier Model for Predicting Employee Churn.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Import Libraries and Load Dataset.
2. Preprocess the Data.
3. Split the Dataset.
4. Train the Decision Tree Classifier.
5. Make Predictions and Evaluate the Model 

## Program:
```

```
import pandas as pd
data=pd.read_csv("Employee.csv")
data
```
```
data["left"].value_counts()
```
```
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le=LabelEncoder()
```
```

## Output:
